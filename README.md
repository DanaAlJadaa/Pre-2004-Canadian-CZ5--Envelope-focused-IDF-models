# Pre-2004-Canadian-CZ5--Envelope-focused-IDF-models
EnergyPlus IDF models developed to evaluate the impact of building envelope characteristics on energy performance in pre-2004 Canadian commercial and multi-unit residential buildings.
The models are derived from DOE pre & post 1980 reference building models and modified to represent style- and period-informed envelope construction assemblies, window-to-wall ratios, airtightness levels, and retrofit scenarios
